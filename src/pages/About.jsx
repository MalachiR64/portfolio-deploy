                        <strong>Hi, I'm Malachi Rosario</strong>, a Sofware Engineer Intern at BlackRock
                        and Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I'm a passionate problem solver who loves 
                        tackling complex challenges through software, data, or mathematics.

                    <p>
                        I've worked with 
                        languages such as <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, {' '}
                        <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, applying them across a range of 
                        technical domains. My experience spans <strong>data structures</strong> and {' '}
                        <strong>algorithms</strong>, <strong>database management</strong>, and building {' '}
                        <strong>data pipelines</strong> and <strong>full-stack applications</strong>. I've also 
                        worked with <strong>cloud computing</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>data science</strong>, {' '}
                        <strong>visualization</strong>, and <strong>automation scripting</strong>, delivering 
                        efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.

                                I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, where I spent much of my time playing {' '}
                                baseball, basketball, and video games  
                                like <em>Pok√©mon</em>. I discovered my love for programming in the later parts of 
                                high school through robotics and coding projects. I enjoyed the problem-solving,  
                                strategy, and planning that programming provided. This passion led me to pursue Computer Science at IIT, where I have been constantly improving.

                                Outside of my classes, I have been a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms and 
                                Object-Oriented Programming. I have enjoyed my time as a TA helping students, and 
                                I have seen much improvement in my communication skills. I am also a brother of Pi
